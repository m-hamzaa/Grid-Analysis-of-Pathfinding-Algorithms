# Grid-Analysis-of-Pathfinding-Algorithms

Comparison of breadth first search (BFS), depth first serach (DFS), and dijkstra algorithms using a grid to find the optimal path from a start state to a goal state. The comparison is done on the basis of performance, time complexity, space complexity. Performace refers to the path cost and nodes explored by the algorithm to find a goal state. Different grids are generated with random obstacles to analyze the algorithms.
